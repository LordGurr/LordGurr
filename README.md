- 🌱 I’m currently learning game development and c# programming. Right now i'm working with monogame and unity
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on something interesting that isn't too grueling or over my head.

I'm currently studying my first year of game development and have some c# and c++ knowledge.
